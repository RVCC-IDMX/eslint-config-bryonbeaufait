## Let's Learn a VS Code Setting

`"editor.tabSize": 2`

This is a code setting in prettier that determines the number of spaces used for each tab throughout your project. By declaring this tab size, it will allow prettier to format your code to look more professional and uniformed from beginning to end. The format is run on paste ( "editor.formatOnPaste": true,) and on save ("editor.formatOnSave": true,). This means that when you paste some code or save your file prettier will implement the tab size where needed.
